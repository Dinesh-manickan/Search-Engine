CHAPTER X--ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE-SCHOLAR

As the lifeless body of King William II, also known as the Red King, lay in the depths of the New Forest, a tumultuous succession of events was set into motion, leading to the rise of Henry, known as Fine-Scholar, to the English throne. The sudden and unexpected demise of the Red King ignited a power struggle for the crown and a series of pivotal decisions that would shape the destiny of England.

Fine-Scholar, upon hearing the news of his brother's death, wasted no time in asserting his claim to the royal treasury. Racing to Winchester with urgency, he aimed to secure the vast wealth that lay within. Yet, standing in his path was the steadfast keeper of the treasure, a man who had been part of a hunting party in the Forest. This guardian of the Crown's riches was resolute in his refusal to relinquish the treasure to Fine-Scholar's grasp. A tense standoff ensued, and Fine-Scholar drew his sword, threatening the treasurer with dire consequences.

However, the keeper of the treasure was not alone in his defiance. He was bolstered by the support of powerful barons who stood firmly by his side. These noble allies declared their determination to elevate Fine-Scholar to the throne, placing him in a position of authority that could not be ignored. Faced with this display of strength, Fine-Scholar recognized the futility of further resistance and relented. The treasure was surrendered, and the stage was set for a new era in English history.

On the third day following the Red King's demise, Fine-Scholar stood before the majestic altar of Westminster Abbey. Here, in this sacred sanctuary, he made a solemn and binding declaration to the assembled nobles and commoners. His words reverberated through the hallowed halls, promising the restoration of church property, the preservation of noble rights, and the reinstatement of the laws that had governed the realm during the reign of Edward the Confessor. With this oath, Fine-Scholar ushered in his reign as King Henry the First.

Henry, born an Englishman, held a unique position of favor with the people due to his personal experiences and heritage. Having faced trials and tribulations, he was perceived as a ruler who could empathize with the struggles of his subjects. Additionally, his English birth set him apart from the Norman rulers who had preceded him, forging a connection with the native populace.

Yearning to solidify his ties to the English population, Henry turned his attention to matters of the heart. He sought to unite the Norman and Saxon races through marriage, and his gaze fell upon Maud the Good, the daughter of the King of Scotland. Despite her lack of affection for Henry, Maud was moved by the persuasive arguments of the nobles, who painted a picture of her marriage as a symbol of harmony that would prevent future animosities and bloodshed. Overcoming her personal reservations, Maud became Queen consort to Henry, further entwining their fates and destinies.

Beneath Henry's charismatic exterior, however, lay a complex and cunning character. He was a man driven by ambition, unafraid to employ any means necessary to achieve his objectives. Henry's reputation for breaking promises and bending the truth cast a shadow over his rule, challenging the very essence of his integrity.

Early in his reign, Henry embarked on a course of action that would demonstrate his propensity for manipulation. The removal and disgrace of the favorites of the late King showcased his determination to reshape the court in his own image. Among those affected was Firebrand, the Bishop of Durham, who found himself imprisoned within the Tower. Despite his predicament, Firebrand's wit and charm allowed him to engineer a daring escape, leveraging his popularity among his guards to make his flight from captivity.

Henry's ambitions extended beyond his courtly intrigues, leading him to confront his own brother, Robert. A prolonged absence from England had left Robert vulnerable, and upon his return, he found himself embroiled in a conflict with Henry. With the support of Firebrand, Robert sought to assert his rightful claim to the English crown. The realm stood divided, with the English largely supporting Henry and the Normans rallying behind Robert.

The tension escalated, and the English sailors themselves deserted Henry's cause, defecting to Normandy. Faced with the prospect of an imminent invasion from his own brother, Henry negotiated a peace, temporarily averting the crisis. Yet, the precarious nature of this accord became evident when Robert, driven by trust and familial ties, returned to Normandy, convinced of Henry's goodwill.

In a stunning display of duplicity, Henry promptly betrayed his brother, reneging on his promises and punishing Robert's loyal followers. Robert's life took a tragic turn, as he languished in captivity, haunted by regret for his squandered opportunities and the choices that had led him astray. His eventual death, blind and imprisoned, served as a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power and the price of ambition.

Henry's schemes continued, and he entered into a marriage alliance with the Emperor of Germany, seeking to strengthen his position on the European stage. However, his methods of raising the necessary funds for the marriage, including imposing heavy taxes on his subjects, bred discontent and resentment among the English population.

The Queen's passing marked a poignant moment in Henry's reign, punctuating the failure of his efforts to bridge the divide between the Norman and English races. The promise of unity remained elusive, and as Normandy and France turned against England, Henry found himself facing external threats that tested his resolve.

Amid these challenges, tragedy struck with the sinking of The White Ship, a vessel carrying Henry's son, William Fitz-Robert. The loss of the ship and its passengers, including noblewomen and prominent figures, cast a shadow over the realm and dealt a personal blow to Henry's heart.

As his reign neared its end, Henry shifted his focus to securing a successor. His daughter Matilda, married to Geoffrey

 Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, emerged as the chosen heir. Despite the solemn oaths of loyalty that accompanied this decision, the Barons harbored their own intentions, undermining Henry's aspirations for a smooth succession.

Upon Henry's passing, his legacy was one of broken promises, deceit, and a realm marred by internal divisions and external conflicts. His reign underscored the delicate balance between ambition and integrity, serving as a cautionary tale of the dangers inherent in a ruler who places personal gain above all else.

While Fine-Scholar possessed a genuine love for learning and a desire to unite disparate elements of society, his avarice, revengeful tendencies, and willingness to manipulate for personal gain marred his rule. His legacy stands as a stark reminder that the foundation of a just and enduring reign lies in virtues such as honesty, integrity, and a commitment to the well-being of the realm and its subjects. The tale of Henry the First, Fine-Scholar, serves as a testament to the complex interplay of power, ambition, and morality in the annals of history.
