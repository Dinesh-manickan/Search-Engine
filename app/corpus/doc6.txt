CHAPTER V--ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE

Canute, a formidable and merciless King in the early days of his reign, held the English realm under his sway for a total of eighteen eventful years. After solidifying his authority by securing the allegiance of Saxon chiefs through solemn oaths, Canute's initial promises of justice and goodwill took a dark turn. With a ruthless fervor, he denounced and ruthlessly executed many of these very chiefs and even targeted the kin of the late King. His chilling declaration, "He who brings me the head of one of my enemies, shall be dearer to me than a brother," became an eerie testament to his relentless pursuit of power. The merciless hunting down of his foes painted a grim picture of a king who amassed a grim assembly of "dear brothers" through these brutal acts.

His intentions towards two young heirs, EDMUND and EDWARD, sons of the ill-fated Ironside, were similarly foreboding. Canute's desire to eliminate potential threats led him to contemplate their demise. However, wary of the repercussions of executing the children on English soil, he dispatched them to the care of the King of Sweden, tasking him with their fate. Mercifully, the King of Sweden defied the expectations of the era and raised the innocent boys with compassion and tenderness.

Normandy occupied a significant portion of Canute's thoughts. The presence of two heirs to the late King's legacy, EDWARD and ALFRED, loomed large in Normandy. These potential claimants, under the guidance of their uncle, the Duke, posed a future challenge to Canute's hold on the throne. However, the Duke displayed a surprising lack of ambition at the time, opting instead to propose a matrimonial alliance. Canute, eager to bolster his own legitimacy and garner favor, wed the widow of The Unready, a woman more interested in the trappings of queenship than in her own children.

With triumphs on the battlefield and the support of valiant English soldiers in foreign lands, Canute's reign became a period of relative prosperity and innovation. In addition to his martial prowess, Canute revealed his artistic and musical inclinations, showcasing his talents as a poet and musician. As he aged, a sense of remorse for the early bloodshed appeared to gnaw at him, prompting a pilgrimage to Rome, undertaken in a penitential pilgrim's attire. Along this journey, he dispensed considerable sums to foreigners, a stark contrast to his earlier policy of extracting wealth from his English subjects. 

Overall, Canute's character underwent a transformation when unchallenged by opposition, shaping him into one of England's most formidable and accomplished kings.

Anecdotes from history recount how Canute, disillusioned with his sycophantic courtiers, devised a unique test of their loyalty. He ordered his throne to be placed on the seashore, commanding the rising tide not to wet the hem of his robe, citing his dominion over the land. As expected, the tide surged in without regard for his command. This theatrical display served as a lesson to his flatterers, a reminder of the insignificance of any earthly ruler before the might of the Creator, who controls the seas with a simple decree. The story underscores the lesson that wisdom can temper a monarch's judgment and that flattery remains a persistent weakness for rulers. Had Canute's courtiers truly understood his true nature, they might have avoided such excessive flattery. Their eagerness to recount the episode suggests their awareness of his vanity, even though his proclamation seemed less remarkable when examined with a discerning eye.

However, the limits of human power are not restricted to the sea's boundaries. The same decree extends to all the world's kings and even reached Canute himself in the year 1035 when he succumbed to death's embrace. At his bedside stood his Norman wife, a fitting companion to his final moments. In those fleeting moments, perhaps Canute's mind wandered once more to the young exiles in Normandy and the distant rumblings of change that echoed across the Channel, as the storm clouds of uncertainty slowly gathered, heralding a potential upheaval for England.

In this way, the narrative of Canute's reign, marked by ambition, brutality, and eventual self-reflection, adds to the complex tapestry of England's history. It serves as a stark reminder that even the mightiest rulers are subject to the inexorable forces of time and change, and that the echoes of their decisions reverberate through the annals of history.
