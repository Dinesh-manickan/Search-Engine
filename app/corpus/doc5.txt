CHAPTER IX—ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED RUFUS

William the Red, driven by urgent purpose, moved swiftly to secure the strategic forts of Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings. His destination was Winchester, where the Royal treasure lay guarded. With determined haste, he arrived and stood before the treasure chamber. Within, a glittering trove awaited him—sixty thousand pounds in silver, alongside precious gold and jewels. With this newfound wealth, he secured the allegiance of the Archbishop of Canterbury, leading to his coronation as King William II.

Rufus, as he was commonly known, wasted no time in asserting his authority. The very captives his father, the Conqueror, had released were returned to their cells, and a curious spectacle of vanity unfurled as he directed a goldsmith to lavish his father's tomb with intricate gold and silver adornments. While a more dutiful son might have tended to his dying father, Rufus, true to his character, displayed a disregard for sentiment, a trait that would become emblematic of his reign.

As the new monarch, Rufus encountered a realm infused with simmering tensions. Bishop Odo and certain influential Norman nobles, who had favored Robert of Normandy's claims to the throne, posed a significant challenge. Their opposition to Rufus manifested in a turbulent atmosphere, a prelude to potential conflict. However, the storm clouds were temporarily quelled by the intervention of powerful nobles, who advocated for a truce between the rival brothers.

With Robert content to rule over Normandy and Fine-Scholar, another of Rufus's brothers, placated by a substantial sum, Rufus likely anticipated a tranquil reign. Yet, history seldom accommodated such simple narratives. The seeds of discord had already been sown, and England's tumultuous past was poised to assert itself once again.

The respite was brief. Bishop Odo and his allies, whose interests spanned both English and Norman lands, began to foment unrest. Their preference for a compliant ruler, epitomized by the affable Robert, clashed with Rufus's uncompromising nature. A contest for dominance loomed on the horizon.

This contest extended beyond English borders. Turmoil reigned in Normandy, where Robert's rule left much to be desired. Meanwhile, in Scotland, two decisive battles ended in defeat for the Scots, resulting in the loss of their King, Malcolm, and his son. Even the Welsh, whose mountainous terrain lent them an advantage, put up fierce resistance against Rufus's authority.

Among the sources of strife was Rufus's manipulation of the English populace, coupled with his oppressive policies. He levied heavy taxes, exploited his subjects, and brazenly clung to the wealth of vacant bishoprics and archbishoprics. This incited the wrath of the clergy, who, in their grief and frustration, would later castigate him in written records.

Rufus was marked by his insatiable greed, epitomized by his alliance with his favored minister, Flambard. A brief religious penitence resulted in the appointment of Anselm, a foreign priest, as Archbishop of Canterbury. Yet, as Rufus's health rebounded, so did his disregard for his promises. Anselm's patience waned, prompting him to seek refuge abroad, leaving Rufus to continue his unscrupulous accumulation of wealth.

Financial machinations took an unexpected turn when Robert of Normandy, facing the allure of the Crusades, chose to sell his dominions to Rufus. The transaction was enabled by the exhaustion of the English people, who were taxed and oppressed to fund the purchase. Simultaneously, the Crusades ignited fervor throughout Europe, inspiring thousands to embark on a holy pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

Robert, driven by his desire to contribute to the Crusades, made the fateful decision to sell his lands. This momentous choice would reverberate through history, altering the dynamics of power and setting in motion a series of events that would ultimately shape the fate of both England and Normandy.

The stage was set for the culmination of multiple threads of history, with the enigmatic New Forest serving as a backdrop. A place steeped in the memory of past injustices, the forest was shrouded in eerie legends and believed by many to be cursed. Its significance would soon be magnified in a manner that no one could foresee.

August arrived, and Rufus, accompanied by his brother Fine-Scholar, embarked on a hunting expedition in the New Forest. A day of camaraderie and sport took a tragic turn as the sun dipped below the horizon. In the fading light, the lifeless body of the Red King was discovered by a humble charcoal-burner. An arrow had pierced his breast, and a veil of uncertainty descended over the forest.

Speculation swirled about the circumstances of Rufus's demise. Was his death a result of accident or design? Some suspected foul play, pointing fingers at various quarters, including his own brother Robert. Yet, amidst the uncertainty, one fact remained clear: the Red King, who had ruled with a heavy hand, had met a mysterious and untimely end.

In death, as in life, Rufus left behind a legacy defined by oppression and turmoil. His reign, marked by greed, manipulation, and conflict, cast a long shadow over England. His departure left a nation grappling with its complex history, a history woven with threads of power, ambition, and tragedy. The story of William the Red serves as a reminder that even in the annals of kings, the true nature of the human spirit can emerge from behind the facade of a crown.
